# Accounting fees

Can you deduct all of your accounting fees?

The only reason you have to pay accounting fees, is because you are self-employed: these fees are therefore fully deductible from your taxes and VAT.

üí°All software that you use for accounting purposes is fully deductible too, including Accountable.

# Advertising goods

Advertising goods need to meet a couple of conditions, in order to be deductible

Those conditions are:  (i) the trade name of the company should be clearly and permanently visible (ii) the value of these goods is reduced (you are able to prove it in a tax audit), (iii) they are largely distributed, (iv) they are consumer items

# Banking fees

Easy

The banking fees you pay for your professional bank account are 100% deductible. After all, you need the account to do your professional activity. It‚Äôs essential when you run a business.

Of course, no VAT is charged on bank charges ‚Äì so nothing can be recovered in that area.

üî® These fees don't require a receipt. Worst case scenario, you can prove the fees with your banking contract.

# Deduct the purchase of an (e-)bike and its accessories

Dreaming of an electric bike? Now‚Äôs the time to go for it, because, as a self-employed professional, it will probably be deductible, both for your income tax and your VAT.

It‚Äôs a double win: not only do you deduct it, but you also save time, which you can then devote to your work or your private life ‚ú®.

## Your bike, which you use to travel to your customers, suppliers, and partners, is deductible.

The purchase of such a bike will be deductible, whether it‚Äôs electric or not, second-hand or not, from a well-known brand (hello Cowboy ü§†, hello Canyon üèî) or not. Good news, then.

In truth, the only thing that matters to justify the deductibility of your bicycle or war machine, is that you‚Äôll need to prove that you‚Äôre using it to get to your client‚Äôs site, your suppliers, or partners: journeys between your home and your office are NOT deductible.

However, this justification is usually quite straightforward and will be easily heard in the event of a tax audit.

## Don‚Äôt forget to depreciate the purchase over the life of your bike

Hopefully, you will keep your bike for several years.

The Belgian tax authorities therefore ask you to spread the deduction over several years, generally 3 years in the case of a bicycle.

## All the accessories for your bike are also deductible.

Not only is the purchase deductible, but you will be able to deduct all the costs relative to your bike: your maintenance (sometimes very expensive), all the parts, your lighting (necessary in winter), your helmet (necessary all the time), cleaning materials, and also the interest on your leasing where applicable.

Note that cycling clothes (trousers and rain jacket) are deductible for the same purpose as your bike (because they are accessories to your bike)! This is not the case for street clothes.

## What about a second bike?

Once they‚Äôve got their bike, many bike owners dream only of their next ride (touch√© üòâ).

If you want to deduct a second bike, it‚Äôs possible. Still, you‚Äôll need to prove a significantly different use (for example, long journeys vs. short journeys) and in all cases, always show that the journeys are to your customers, suppliers, or partners. Be careful in the event of a tax audit, especially if the cost of the bike is significant and you are already deducting a car.

In Accountable, you will find all the categories of business expenses relating to your bike under Vehicle &gt; Bicycle or Electric Bike.

<!-- image -->

## Expert‚Äôs advice ‚ú®

The deductibility is limited to the professional use of the bicycle, of course. 

If you use it every day, no problem. If you use it less often or find it difficult to prove exclusive business use, we advise you to limit business use to the actual use you make of it.

Some self-employed people choose to hire a bike for strictly professional use via Swapfiets or Villo!

# Building development

Deduct it, with the adequate depreciation rate!

To the extent that invest in building developments to grow your business, you deduct them.

Of course, you take into account the rate of depreciation of these assets. This rate depends on their presumed useful life, up to 3% for a building with an estimated life span of 30 years.

Your latest building developments might be eligible to the federal deduction for investment.

Between March and December 2020, this deduction increases to 25%. This is a government decision, in the context of the corona crisis.

Do you work from home? You can deduct a part of this cost in proportion to the part you use for professional purposes. The deductibility depends on the square meters that are dedicated to your work.

üí°Working from home can be a nice fiscal opportunity: other costs like water, electricity and heating also work according to these rules.

# Deduct business gifts: the case of tobacco and spirits

## Business gifts in the form of spirits or tobacco are 50% tax deductible.

Like all business gifts, this type of gift is 50% deductible from your professional income as an independent. So there are no different rules for liquors or tobacco.

## However, VAT will not be deductible on tobacco and spirits, with 4 exceptions.

The rule for VAT is different: VAT is never deductible on alcohol and tobacco, even if the value of the gift remains under ‚Ç¨50, excluding VAT, per year and per client, as it is the case for other business gifts.

There is one exception though: alcohol and tobacco are deductible in case they will be resold, provided as part of a service delivery (e.g. meal to take in or away), or given away to clients or prospects as sampling or tasting. Only professionals in these industries or in HoReCa may therefore be concerned.

In Accountable, you will find business gifts in the Marketing &gt; Business Gifts category. Just make sure you don‚Äôt tick the ‚Äúinvoice‚Äù box to avoid deducting VAT.

üí°Wine, portos, champagnes do not belong to the category of liquors and spirits: their alcohol content remains under 22¬∞.

# Business gifts: tax and VAT deductible?

If you want to buy a gift for a client, partner, or employee, you can deduct part of the cost in Belgium. However, the deductibility is not always the same.

## What counts as a business gift?

Business gifts are presents that self-employed professionals give to clients or business partners to strengthen professional relationships. Common examples include a box of chocolates, a bottle of wine, or VIP tickets to an event (though you must be able to prove it was a business meeting).

If the gift has a clear company logo and is of low value‚Äîsuch as pens, calendars, or notebooks‚Äîit is considered promotional material and is fully deductible, including VAT.

But what about the deductibility of regular business gifts?

## Business gifts are tax and VAT deductible

### Business gifts up to ‚Ç¨50

- A client gift is generally 50% deductible from income tax.
- If the total value per client is below ‚Ç¨50 (excluding VAT) per calendar year, the VAT is 100% deductible.

Example:
You give a client a bottle of wine worth ‚Ç¨40. In this case, the VAT is fully deductible, and 50% of the cost is tax-deductible.

### Client gifts between ‚Ç¨50 and ‚Ç¨250

- A gift costing more than ‚Ç¨50 (excluding VAT) but less than ‚Ç¨250 (excluding VAT) is also 50% deductible from income tax.
- However, the VAT is not deductible. You may still deduct 50% of the total amount, including VAT, from your personal or corporate taxes.

Example:
You buy a gift basket for ‚Ç¨120 (including VAT). You cannot reclaim the VAT, but you can deduct ‚Ç¨60 from your personal or corporate income tax.

### Business gifts over ‚Ç¨250

- Business gifts worth more than ‚Ç¨250 are 100% deductible, but there is a significant drawback.
- Gifts valued over ‚Ç¨250 are considered a ‚Äúbenefit in kind‚Äù (VAA/ATN) for the recipient.

As a result, you must issue a fiscal form 281.50, and the recipient has to declare the gift on their tax return. Not everyone is happy about this.

Example:
You give a client a watch worth ‚Ç¨300. You can deduct the full cost, but your client will have to pay taxes on it.

## Exceptions to the deductibility of business gifts in Belgium

### Foreign Business Gifts

If you give a business gift during a foreign business trip, it is 100% deductible for tax purposes.

It doesn‚Äôt matter where the gift was purchased or who the recipient is, as long as you can prove you were on a business trip abroad. üòâ

### Tobacco and Strong Alcohol (&gt;22¬∞)

The VAT on tobacco products and alcoholic beverages with more than 22% alcohol is never deductible, regardless of the value of the gift. A bottle of champagne or wine is safe, but a bottle of whisky is not.

‚ö†Ô∏è  Watch out, in case of tax audit, they might ask for a receipt.

üí° Gifts offered during a trip abroad are 100% deductible, whether you bought them in Belgium or abroad.

# Buying studies, works, services

As long as the rules of the game are clear

You pay an expert to provide you with a detailed market analysis of the country where you intend to export or you pay the services of a consultant?

You are clearly paying this to support the growth of your business. It is therefore deductible.

However, do not arouse the mistrust of the taxman with vague invoices and objectives. Any expenses you incur in this area must have supporting documents and ‚Ä¶ professional utility!

Did a subcontractor send  you an invoice that is too vague for your taste? 
Don't hesitate to ask for a credit note and a new, more detailed invoice in exchange.

# Deduct the cost of your camera

## To deduct your camera, the link with your activity as a self-employed must be obvious.

Thinking of buying a nice Canon camera? A little expensive, yes ‚Äì but so exciting üòâ.

The rule is simple: in the event of a tax audit, you must be able to prove that you take photos as part of your self-employed activities.

Some cases are obvious: you are a photographer (and sell your photos), you are an artist (and need, for example, to scout places, get inspired), you are a healthcare professional (and take photos of your patients to share at seminars), no worries, you can deduct this purchase easily.

Some cases are less obvious, but possible nonetheless: do you take team photos? At your customer‚Äôs premises? On business trips? Do you use these photos in your marketing? On your website? Your LinkedIn profile? If so, then you can deduct the cost of buying a (nice) camera. Make the most of it.

The cost of the camera doesn‚Äôt really affect deductibility. However, if the tax authorities refuse, the impact will be as great as the amount initially deducted.

## Do you also use your camera in your private life?

If you use your camera in your private life, it would be wise to deduct only part of it, the professional part.

This will make it easier to justify the expense in the event of a tax audit.

## Don‚Äôt forget to deduct the purchase of lenses and all your photo accessories.

These are often an even greater source of expenditure than the cost of the camera itself. So be sure to deduct the following expenses:

- Lenses, which are often expensive
- Filters, which often break
- All accessories (tripod, shoulder strap, etc.)
- The software you use to process your photos (Adobe Lightroom, of course).

# Deduct canteen

## Could you deduct your lunch?

The canteen, in this context, does not refer to the refectory of a school: it refers to the meals you take and offer to your team or partners, as part of your working day.

You will then typically deduct your delivery and take-away meals (e.g. Deliveroo, UberEats) as canteen costs.

As per deductibility, you deduct such costs at 50%, not 69% like for restaurants, for your income tax and generally do not recover VAT.

In Accountable, you find the Canteen category under Foods &amp; Drink &gt; Canteen &amp; reception

A tad outdated but maybe important to know: in the context of a lockdown, our accounting partner indicates that if, in order not to break your productivity, you have a meal delivered to your door by e.g. Deliveroo or UberEats, then you deduct 50% of this meal - as a canteen cost.

# Deduct car accessories

## From your phone holder and charging cable, to a GPS and parking pass: car accessories are tax-deductible

For several years now, the tax deductibility of your car has in fact been determined by its CO2 emissions. The tax deductibility of the cost of car accessories such as a phone holder, charging cable, GPS, parking card, anti-freeze blanket and so on, is the same as that of your car itself.

Say you can deduct 60% of your car as a professional expense (taking into account the outcome of the formula based on CO2 emissions and your professional use of it), then you can also deduct 60% of all your car accessories for tax purposes. It‚Äôs that simple.

The same principle applies to other costs associated with your company car:

- Repairs and maintenance
- The interest you pay on a car loan
- Insurance
- Vehicle registration tax (GST)
- Electricity for charging and fuel costs

### What car accessories are tax deductible?

In principle, all car accessories are tax-deductible to the same extent as your car is deductible as a professional expense. However, always make sure the car accessories are relevant and don‚Äôt overdo it.

A hands-free kit, phone holder and charging cable to safely answer business calls is certainly a justifiable professional expense, just as a sticker advertising your company is. Or a blue parking pass to park correctly and a coat rack to attach to the headrest for your coat when visiting a client. These are all good examples of car accessories that are tax deductible.

A sunshade for the window or a mini TV for the little ones in the back seat are in principle also accessories, but in most cases have no direct link to your professional activity. So these purchases are better paid for privately.

### How to calculate the maximum tax deductibility of your professional vehicle?

To find out what percentage of the car cost is tax deductible, we take into account the formula based on the CO2 emissions of your car on the one hand, and its professional use on the other.

The CO2 formula looks like this:

120%- (0.5% x [coefficient] x CO2 )

For hybrid cars and combustion engine cars, the tax deductibility decreases significantly in the coming years. You can read more about the calculation and tax deductibility of company cars here.

üí°The installation of a hands-free kit is 100% deductible! The financing costs of your car, too.

# Deduct your car insurance

## Your car insurance is tax-deductible

You can deduct all the costs you incur for your company car, including the car insurance. You do this to the extent you use the car professionally and based on the maximum tax deductibility, which depends on the CO2 emissions of your car (calculated using the gram formula).

Suppose you have a car that is tax deductible up to 80% according to the gram formula, but you, as a self-employed person with a secondary occupation, only use your car professionally 50% of the time. Then the tax deductibility of your car and all car expenses is 40% (50% of 80%). Within the same example, are you self-employed as a main occupation and do you use your car 100% of the time for professional purposes? Then you can deduct 80% of all car expenses, including your car insurance, as professional expenses.

## What car expenses are tax deductible?

The purchase, financial renting or leasing of your car is (partially) tax deductible. To what extent and how to calculate this, read here.

In addition, all other costs associated with your car are also tax deductible to the same percentage. Think about:

- Car insurance
- Repairs and maintenance
- The interest you pay on a car loan
- Car accessories
- Immobilization tax (BIV)
- Fuel or electricity for charging*

*In the case of a hybrid car, the fuel (gasoline, diesel, gas) is up to 50% tax deductible.

It does not matter whether you are self-employed as a main or secondary occupation, and it applies to sole proprietorships as well as partnerships.

So next time you receive an invoice from your insurance company, be sure to upload it in Accountable or provide it to your accountant. There, that‚Äôs another few bucks the FOD/SPF won‚Äôt get from you.

# Deduct the maintenance &amp; repair costs of your car

Vehicle maintenance and/or repair costs are deductible to the same extent as your car is. So, if your car is only 70% deductible, the same principle applies to maintenance and repair costs. It‚Äôs as simple as that üòâ In addition to maintenance and repair costs, the same applies to other costs associated with your car or commercial vehicle:

- Car accessories
- Car insurance
- Fuel or electricity
- Registration tax
- Interest on financing

### How do you calculate the tax deductibility of your car?

To what extent your car or van is tax-deductible is calculated using a formula. This formula determines the deduction percentage based on the CO2 emissions of your car.

120%- (0.5% x [coefficient] x CO2 )

In addition, to find out the deductible portion of your car and car expenses, you must also consider the professional use of your car.

An example: you purchase a hybrid car in 2024 and according to the formula, your car is up to 95% tax deductible. You are self-employed in main occupation and use your car for professional purposes 80% of the time. You may then deduct your company car and all associated car expenses, including repairs, repair and maintenance of your car, for 76% for tax purposes (80% of 95%).

Do you use the car professionally 100% of the time? Then the deduction percentage is 95%.

Are you self-employed in a secondary occupation and use the car for professional purposes only 50% of the time? Then you may enter 47% of the cost as professional expenses (50% of 95%).

Please note, in the coming years the maximum deduction percentage decreases significantly.

# Deduct your car

Your car is often one of the most important business expenses you can incur as an independent in Belgium (sadly ü•π?): the amounts you can deduct through your car are usually significant and therefore allow you to reduce your taxes considerably.

Be careful, though, because the deductibility of business expenses related to your car is a thorny issue, that the government and the tax authorities are dealing with very actively.

How? By limiting the maximum amount you can deduct in relation to your vehicle.

For you, we, therefore, detail the rules in force and give you simple and precise examples to understand how to maximise the deduction of your transport costs. If you have any questions, please contact us via email at support@accountable.eu.

## You buy your vehicle after 1 July 2023 üÜï

In 2023, the rules changed to reflect the government‚Äôs desire to shift the business vehicle fleet to electric.

### Thermal and hybrid cars

For internal combustion and hybrid cars, the maximum deduction for your vehicle, and all related costs ‚ö†Ô∏è, is then given by the following rules:

- Purchase before 1 July 2023: 120%- (0.5% x [coefficient] x CO2 )
- From 1 July 2023: max 75%.
- From 1 January 2026: max 50%.
- From 1 January 2027: max 25%.
- From 1 January 2028: 0%.

Please note that the fossil fuel costs of hybrids are deductible to a maximum of 50%.

### Electric car

For fully electric cars, the maximum deduction is higher and is calculated as follows:

- From 1 January 2023: max 100%
- From 1 January 2027: max 95% -&gt; max 67.5% in 2031

A higher deduction should therefore allow you to recover the higher purchase cost of an electric vehicle. It is therefore important to do the math before making your purchase decision.

### You bought your vehicle between 2018 and 2023

In 2020, the rules for deducting expenses related to your business vehicle also changed: you deduct your car according to the business use you make of it and, since January 2020 for a large proportion of vehicles, according to the CO2 emissions of your vehicle.

120% ‚Äì (0.5% x coefficient x CO2/km)

The CO2/km, you will find it in the documents of your vehicle. The coefficient will be as follows:

The coefficient depends on the type of combustion engine of the car:

<!-- image -->

All company cars, whether new or used, put into circulation before 2020, fall under this new regime.

All cars ordered or purchased from 2018 onwards by a natural person will also fall under this regime.

## Did you buy your car before 2018?

Are you an eenmanzaak or personne physique who bought or ordered a car before 2018? You will remain under the old system of deductibility, in stages.

The maximum deductibility applies to the purchase (or depreciation of the purchase) of the vehicle, but also to all deductible business expenses related to your vehicle: think of accessories, maintenance, insurance, taxes, storage costs for your winter tyres. The list is long ‚≠êÔ∏è

<!-- image -->

## Expert‚Äôs advice ‚ú®

Determining the date of purchase and the regime can be complicated. Here are 2 simple cases to help you know which regime you fall under:
When it comes to a used or stock vehicle, it's simple: it's the date of purchase, pure and simple.
When you order a new vehicle, case law shows that the date of the order form can be used as the date of purchase.
So be careful üòâ

# Carsharing

Shared mobility, a safer bet than your own car?
As the legislation is not yet very well developed on this subject, the general regime applies: shared cars are partially deductible, same as any other car.

Are you renting a shared car for an exclusively business trip? In that case, a broader deductibility could be justified‚Ä¶ provided that you can prove that the trip is exclusively for business reasons and that you did not take advantage of it to go shopping!

## The cost of a shared car is partially deductible

Car sharing or car sharing is partially deductible, following the same principle as for ‚Äúnormal‚Äù car expenses. To determine the tax deductibility of a shared car, you should therefore take into account:

- the CO2 emissions and fuel type of your shared car
- its professional use

Here is a simple example for you

You pre-book a Cambio shared car to visit a potential new client. The total cost of your reservation is ‚Ç¨ 60.00.

- Electric car: as the shared car is 100% electric, you also enjoy a tax deductibility of 100% is. In this case, you can deduct the ‚Ç¨ 60.00 in full for tax purposes.
- Hybrid car or combustion engine (diesel, petrol or LPG) : if the share car is not fully electric, we apply this formula:
    - Purchased before July 1, 2023: 120%- (0.5% x [coefficient] x CO2 )
    - Purchased after July 1, 2023: 75% ‚Äì (0.5% x [coefficient] x CO2 )

Suppose it is a hybrid share car (coefficient = 1) from 2021, with CO2 emissions of 50 grams per kilometer, the deductibility in this case is 95%. Thus, you may deduct ‚Ç¨ 57.00 for tax purposes.

In practice, in Accountable, you can create a car profile that corresponds to the car you use most often from your preferred service provider, and assign all your expenses to this profile. Easier to manage.

Do you stop at your grandmother‚Äôs after your company visit and drive on to the supermarket afterwards? Then the use is not 100% professional and the cost is only partially deductible. It‚Äôs up to you to make a realistic and fair assessment.

## Deductible VAT for car-sharing

As with your own company car, you may only partially deduct VAT with a shared car. The maximum is 50%. You should also reduce this percentage if your trips are not exclusively professional.

## What if you need to refuel or recharge?

If you travel a lot of miles with a shared car, there is a relatively high chance that you will have to stop to refuel or recharge. It‚Äôs good to know that fossil fuel you purchase for your hybrid car is never more than 50% deductible.

However, in most cases, a refueling or charging card is included with the reservation of a shared car. So you don‚Äôt have to break your head over this, because this cost is included in the total price of your reservation.

## What proof do I need to deduct the car share?

If you also want to deduct part of the VAT, you will need the official invoice. You can request this from the sharing service. Make sure that your official name and VAT number are then mentioned on the invoice. Shared services often have an option for professional use. Use this and you will automatically receive a valid VAT invoice.

If you are not liable for VAT, a payment receipt will suffice.

# Deduct your carwash fees

The cost of the carwash is tax-deductible to the same extent as your company car. The maximum tax deductibility depends on the CO2 emissions of your car and its professional use.

Suppose your company car is 70% tax deductible, so are the carwash costs. The carwash belongs to ‚Äúother car expenses,‚Äù just like maintenance, car accessories, car insurance, parking costs‚Ä¶.

## Carwash expenses are tax-deductible

The maximum tax deductibility of your company car depends on the CO2 emissions of your car. To find out the deductibility, apply this formula:

120%- (0.5% x [coefficient] x CO2 )

If you‚Äôre not sure how much your car‚Äôs maximum tax deduction is, you can consult this article.

An example:

You bought a gasoline-powered car this year (2024). This car, according to the above gram formula, is 60% tax deductible. You are self-employed in a secondary occupation and you use the car for professional purposes only 50% of the time. Then the maximum tax deductibility is 30% (50% of 60%). Other costs related to your company car, such as the car wash, are then equally tax deductible at 30%.

In practice, you deduct the carwash expenses, excluding VAT, from your taxes.

If you receive a VAT invoice for your carwash, you can also deduct a portion of the VAT: 35% if it is a mixed vehicle, 85% if it is a commercial vehicle.

In the case of a company vehicle, you only deduct 100% VAT if you can prove that you use the vehicle exclusively for business purposes and have an alternative for private use.

# Deduct clothing and accessories

## Your clothing purchases are generally not deductible.

For income tax, general-purpose clothing purchases will systematically be rejected by the tax authorities. Therefore, clothes known as ‚Äúcity dress‚Äù, evening‚Äù, ‚Äúceremony‚Äù, ‚Äútravel‚Äù or ‚Äúleisure‚Äù are NOT recommended deductible expenses.

It‚Äôs clear: deducting your last suit, even if superb &amp; from Paul Smith, from represents a significant tax risk.

## You can only deduct ‚Äúgenuinely‚Äù professional clothing

The only exception is professional clothing imposed, for example, by labor regulations. Think of the lawyer‚Äôs robe, the craftsman‚Äôs work uniform: those will be deductible ‚≠êÔ∏è.

If you are an artist or performer, the clothes (&amp; accessories) you buy in view of performing your art will be deductible. The best examples? The clothes you can only wear while performing (dominatrix dresses are welcome üòâ)

## What about the VAT deductibility of clothes?

For VAT, the rule is similar: the deduction will only be possible if the activity carried out by the taxpayer requires the use of these specific professional clothing.

<!-- image -->

## Expert‚Äôs advice ‚ú®

Specific professional clothing is fully tax deductible. 

This refers to clothing that is required by regulations in certain sectors and must be worn during working hours (helmets, safety shoes, etc.) or clothing specific to the profession. 
Think of a lawyer's gown or a baker's work vest. 

In principle, the cost of urban or leisure clothing is not tax deductible, except in certain cases. For example, if clothing costs are booked as trade goods or if the costs for such clothing are recharged then the deduction prohibition does not come into play. 
Also, when clearly visible advertising is placed on the clothing, the costs are deductible as publicity costs. 

Regarding VAT, only the VAT on specific professional clothing is deductible as well as when it comes to publicity costs.

# Commercial samples

For taxes, there is only one rule: the product must belong to the company.

This is logical, the costs incurred in the production of commercial samples are only deductible for products that the self-employed person sells or produces himself. It cannot be called a sample if it is not a ‚Äúhomemade‚Äù object.

‚ö†Ô∏è Be careful, you will always need to provide proof that you have distributed these samples to your customers or potential targets - otherwise you risk being refused in the event of a tax audit.

# Deduct computers, laptops, tablets and phones

## Maximize tech professional expenses

IT costs are generally an easy source for deductible expenses for independents in Belgium, regardless of their profession: indeed, the link with your professional activity is usually obvious and there are very few professions that can function without IT (you have to draw up invoices, answer calls from your customers, suppliers or prospects, etc.).

So you can go ahead and deduct the cost of buying your computer, your tablet (including iPad) or your phone.

## Do you use your computer in both your private and professional life?

In this case, the VAT deductibility of ‚Äòtechnological‚Äô costs (e.g. computers, keyboards, screens, mice, cables, adapters, etc.) is capped at 75% maximum, regardless of the professional use (this is the tolerance given by the Belgian tax authorities under the name of ‚Äògeneral flat rate‚Äô).
For personal income tax, the flat rate does not apply with the same severity: the deductibility must simply reflect the professional use of the equipment.

Accountable automatically limits the VAT deduction of such costs, if they are mixed, to 75%. You avoid any risk of a fine.

## Lifetime and amortisation of IT purchases

IT purchases are generally expensive and their life usually spans over several years. For this reason, Belgian Tax Authorities require you to depreciate them over several years (e.g. 3 years).

In Accountable, these purchases are automatically depreciated, so that there is no risk of error (unless of course you decide to do otherwise).

## Is it possible to deduct more than one phone at the same time?

Yes, it is possible, if you can justify the simultaneous use of both phones.
Software developers who need to test their applications on multiple platforms (Android vs iOS, Windows vs MacOS, etc.) are perfect example of such situations ‚≠êÔ∏è

## Expert‚Äôs advice ‚ú®

üí° You only use the technology for your work or is it owned by your work? You deduct the expense for 100% for income tax as well as VAT. 

Careful, in case of in audit, you might need to prove that you only use if for work (so make sure there are no holiday pictures and only professional software on your computer).

# Deduct the cost of conference entrances &amp; other events

## You can deduct the cost of conferences you attend for your professional activity

Do you attend a conference or congress to acquire (or brush up üòâ ) your knowledge? Or simply to network and develop your network?

As long as the link to your professional activity is clear, you can of course deduct the entry fees for these events. That‚Äôs obvious, but you shouldn‚Äôt forget it, especially given the increasing cost of these expenses.

## Don‚Äôt forget to deduct the cost of the entire trip.

If you are traveling to a specific location for a business event, don‚Äôt forget to deduct all the costs associated with the trip as well:

- Hotel costs, for overnight stays related to the event
- Restaurant costs, for the days of the event
- Travel costs: train, plane, taxi, bus, rental car
- Business gifts you may have made for your customers or partners

If you are a limited company (BV or SRL), don‚Äôt forget that you can replace actual expenses for short trips and restaurants with per-diems (more information here).

# Construction

Take the depreciation rate into account!

You are making a major investment: a new studio comes out of the ground, for example. You deduct this construction in proportion to your professional use.

You also take into account its depreciation rate. As an indication, for a building with an estimated lifespan of 30 years, the annual depreciation rate will be 3%.

Are you self-employed in a company? You should know that on 1 January 2020, a ‚Äúpro rata temporis‚Äù depreciation came into force for all assets acquired from 2020 onwards. You therefore deduct in proportion to the remaining months in the year of your investment.

Are you self-employed as an individual? There is no pro rata temporis depreciation. Did you buy in October? You still amortize for the whole year.

Certain investments qualify for a federal tax advantage, the deduction for investment. Check here whether this is the case for yours: https://bit.ly/3cVAjdO.

Between March and December 2022, this deduction increases to 25%. This is a government decision, in the context of the corona crisis.

# Decorative items

The decoration of your office is deductible

No worries: the items you buy for your office are 100% deductible, both for VAT and for income tax.

This applies to all capital goods (eg furniture, refrigerators, etc.), landscaping (flowers, plants, etc.) and to any other type of decoration that you can imagine.

All these items are 100% tax deductible, even your waiting room and reception decoration.

‚ö†Ô∏è Remember that investments in works of art are not deductible, because their value does not decrease over time. Buying a (real) Monet will therefore unfortunately not lower your tax base.

# Deduct medical expenses

As a self-employed person in Belgium, you can deduct part of your medical expenses as business expenses.

However, this is not without risk: here we explain how and why.

## You can deduct expenses directly incurred in the course of your business

In general, medical expenses are not deductible as business expenses.

However, tax authorities may, on a case-by-case basis, accept a partial deduction (at 50%) if the self-employed person can prove that the exercise of his profession requires him to incur these expenses.

In the event of an audit, it will therefore be necessary to be able to demonstrate this professional necessity by means of attestations and medical reports.

Here‚Äôs a simple example to illustrate the situation: as a consultant, you may be required to work in a production area and operate noisy machinery, for which it is advisable to use ear protection.

In this case, you can deduct 50% of the cost of a visit to your ENT doctor. Please note, however, that in the event of an inspection, the inspector may not accept the deduction: this is at his discretion.

## Hospitalization insurance, on the other hand, is never tax-deductible.

Health insurance, like membership of your mutual insurance company, is never tax-deductible.

We do, however, distinguish 2 cases of use, depending on your status.

You are a self-employed individual: you pay for your insurance through your private account and do not deduct the cost.

You are a company director: you can take out health insurance through your company and pay the premium through your company account. However, you will be taxed on this benefit as a benefit in kind,

If you have any questions, don‚Äôt hesitate to contact our tax coaches at support@accountable.eu or directly in the app.

The purchase of tools, on the other hand, is easily deductible: in our example, the noise-cancelling helmet used on construction sites will be fully deductible. 

Remember to keep a copy of the invoice, for example in Accountable (category: tools).

# Deduct post and shipping costs

Of course this is a professional cost!

Your postal and shipping costs are deductible for both VAT and income tax, as long as the costs are incurred for a business purpose.

As a company, you will naturally need to send and receive mail, not only through email. So do not forget to deduct your postal letters and your packages (professional, of course): you will see your taxes decrease by a factor of 100%.

‚ö†Ô∏è Of course, only your postal costs related to your professional activity fall into this category. The costs for sending packages for your private life (for example via Zalando) are not deductible. It is important to make a distinction, especially in case of tax audits.

# Deduct the cost of your dog

As a Belgian self-employed person, you can deduct the cost of a dog, provided it is used for the security or protection of your office, premises or professional practice, even if your office is at home.

Suppose you can prove the ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù character (the cat will therefore a priori not be deductible). In that case, this case is not hazardous: the Belgian Ruling Commission ruled on the question in 2015 (ruling no. 2015.268, 30.06.2015) üòâ.

## Deducting the purchase of your dog

The cost of buying your dog, as well as the cost of his kennel (if you decide to build one), are deductible.

Be careful, though, as these are investments (their economic life exceeds one year). You‚Äôll need to depreciate them over time.

The tax authorities don‚Äôt specify the depreciation period, so it‚Äôs up to you or your accountant to decide. In practical terms, 5 to 10 years seems perfectly reasonable and defensible in the event of an audit.

## Deducting veterinary expenses

Veterinary expenses are also deductible, considering that you already deduct your dog as a guard dog. This is all the more attractive as veterinary costs are generally high.

They are as deductible as any other expenses you incur for your dog.
These include:

- food (a major cost item)
- construction and maintenance of his kennel,
- toys,
- leash,
- muzzle (if applicable)

## What percentage of deductible expenses can you deduct for your dog?

Please note that expenses related to your dog will always be deductible to the extent of its professional use.

In this case, the deduction will be entirely that of the business premises: 100% if you deduct it entirely, as a professional percentage of the surface area (e.g. 15%) if shared with your home.

Don‚Äôt hesitate to contact our tax coaches in the application if you have any questions on this subject üê∂.

## What about other pets?

They won‚Äôt be deductible unless you can prove the direct link to the security of your office.

# Demonstrations and promotional events

Costs for demonstrations are 100% deductible, costs for promotional events only for 50%

Demonstration costs are, for example, costs that you make when you are distributing commercial samples (like for example a tasting). These costs are for 100% deductible, for VAT as well as taxes.

Costs you make because of promotional events, like product launches, open houses, etc. are usually for 50% deductible for income tax. There is just one exception: the costs you make for a showroom (like furniture, building, staff) are for 100% deductible.

For VAT these costs are usually not deductible, unless you can prove it‚Äôs more like a product demonstration (see above).

üî• The deductibility of promotional events at 50% is including the non-deductible VAT, if necessary - an extra advantage for you.

# Director‚Äôs compensation

## The company director‚Äôs remuneration is fully deductible.

When your company, a BV, SRL, NV, SA, or any other form of legal entity, pays its director (you), it is a deductible expense.

This remuneration will be 100% deductible.

## Withholding tax and social security contributions

The director‚Äôs compensation will be subject to withholding tax, which will generally be declared (on FinProf) and paid by the company (full details here on the SPF/FOD website). The amount of the withholding tax depends on your personal situation (status, dependent children, etc.).

As a director, you therefore generally receive a ‚Äònet‚Äô remuneration: you will no longer have to pay tax on this remuneration.

As a director again, like all independents, you are also required to pay social contributions, which are calculated on the basis of your remuneration as an executive.

## Pay slip

Directors‚Äô compensation should be the subject of a 281.20 form, which must be submitted to Belcotax-on-web by 1 March of the following year at the latest.

## What if you are a natural person?

If you are a self-employed natural person (eenmanszaak / personne physique) and you transfer yourself money (by bank transfer, for example), this does not count as a business expense: you are not dealing with two separate entities. It is merely a transfer of funds.

As a natural person, you cannot ‚Äúpay yourself a salary‚Äù, at least from an accounting point of view. It makes no sense.

That said, you can of course transfer funds to another bank account, without the slightest worry üòâ.

<!-- image -->

## Expert‚Äôs advice ‚ú®

Directors' remuneration is probably the least tax-efficient form of compensation.

If you are a director and shareholder of an SRL that has cash and is making a profit, consider paying yourself dividends: they will be taxed at 20 or 25% (corporation tax) and then subsequently at 15% or 30% depending on certain conditions (). This will generally be less than the progressive rate for professional income.

To qualify for the reduced rate of corporation tax at 20%, among 5 other conditions, you must pay yourself a director's fee of min. ‚Ç¨45,000 a year. Only the 1st tranche of 100,000‚Ç¨ of profit will be taxed at this reduced rate.

To qualify for the reduced rate of withholding tax on dividends (15%), you will need to meet certain conditions relating to the company's capital and, above all, wait until the 3rd tax year. You must therefore be able to wait to benefit from this lower rate of taxation.

# Deduct an electric car

## Electric cars are the winning choice when it comes to tax deductibility

You may have noticed a number of self-employed professionals buying or leasing electric cars, despite the fact that their price is generally higher.

The reason is simple: the ultra-favorable deductibility of these vehicles, and their relative equipment!

For vehicles purchased before 1 January 2020, the deduction was 120%.
Deductibility is now 100% for vehicles purchased from 2020 onwards.

Only from 2031 does tax deductibility decrease significantly, to a maximum of 67.5%. So you still have some time to purchase a tax-advantaged company car üòâ.

## Hybrids vs. fully electric vehicles

The deductibility of hybrids is not the same as that of fully electric vehicles and, since 2023, the appeal of hybrids has been seriously reduced, at least from a tax point of view.

For hybrids purchased between 2018 and 1 July 2023, the deductibility was given by the following formula, which depends on the CO2 emissions of your hybrid car:

```
120% - (0.5% x CO2/km)
```

For hybrids purchased after 1 July 2023, the deductibility will be capped at 75% and this rate will be further reduced in 2026, 2027 &amp; 2028 (see details).

## Charging points get a tax-deductible boost

The installation of a charging point, subject to certain conditions, will be more than 100% tax deductible (which means you get a kind of tax ‚Äòcredit‚Äô).

Deductibility will depend on the date of installation:

- Before 31 December 2022 (tolerated on 31 March 2023): 200%
- Before 31 August 2024: 150
- After 31 August 2024: 100%

The conditions for claiming this deduction are as follows:

- The charging point must be depreciated on a straight-line basis over at least five taxable periods,
- The charging point must be acquired as new or made up as new,
- The charging point must be accessible to the public and freely accessible to any third party at least during the company‚Äôs usual opening or closing hours,
- The charging point must be intelligent.

## The cost of electricity is also fully deductible

All costs relating to your vehicle follow the same deductibility rules: maintenance, insurance, accessories, registration tax, etc.

- The electricity used to recharge your electric vehicle is therefore 100% deductible (if your vehicle was purchased after 2018).
- Electricity from your hybrid purchased after 1 July 2023 will be deductible at a maximum of 75%. Worse still, the cost of buying their fossil fuel will be deductible at a maximum of 50%.

This is precisely why electric vehicles are so interesting from a tax perspective üòâ.

üí°Would you rather invest in a hybrid? Note that from 2020, your hybrid should emit less than 50 gr CO2/km and have energy capacity under 0,5 kWh/100 kg to be considered as such.

# Deduct fines for your utility vehicle

## Fines are never tax-deductible

As a self-employed person, whether you are an individual or a limited company, you can only pay fines, not deduct them.

You will therefore never be able to deduct a fine for tax purposes, even if you receive it during your business or in the name of your company (for example, if the vehicle is registered in your company‚Äôs name).

There are two possible scenarios for payment:

- If you pay a fine from your business account (as a self-employed individual or company), it will be included in your non-admitted expenses.
- If you pay the fine from your personal account, it will not appear in your accounts.

VAT is even simpler: there is no VAT on fines.

Speeding, a driving offense in your commercial vehicle?
You pay the fine but don‚Äôt deduct it‚Ä¶

## You can deduct a parking ticket for your utility vehicle

It‚Äôs important to distinguish between fines (e.g. for speeding) and parking charges, which apply, for example, when you forget to pay your parking meter.

These parking charges are fully deductible.

And for your van, if you deduct the parking charge, you can actually deduct 100% of it.

# Fines

In general, these costs are non-deductible!

Fines, even if imposed as part of the professional activity, are generally never deductible from income tax.

It is even simpler for VAT because there is no VAT on fines.

There are, however, a number of exceptions. For example, some fines, related to taxes, are deductible for your income taxes. This includes proportional VAT fines, fines designated as VAA for beneficiary, fines for handing over your annual accounts too late and fines that are considered NTA in the name of the beneficiary.

üí° "Half-day" parking cards don' really count as fines and are therefore fully deductible. Of course, this is only acceptable as long as the parking takes place to increase or maintain your business income.

# Deduct flight costs

## You can deduct the cost of plane tickets for your business trips

Your plane tickets are fully deductible when, and only when, you can prove the business nature of your trip.

Typical examples: a trip to attend a conference or trade fair (even in Cannes), a visit to one of your customers or suppliers or even a prospecting visit are all excellent cases in which you can deduct the full cost of your plane (or train) ticket.

In certain special cases (e.g. you are a professional photographer in a particular field, you are a musician in a particular style), you will be able to deduct trips that other independents will never be able to deduct. Be careful, though, that you can always prove the link to income received (vaguely looking for inspiration is generally not enough üòâ ).

## Do you combine business and leisure travel?

You will only deduct the plane tickets relating to the business part of the trip. The same applies to all your hotel and restaurant expenses: you should only deduct nights that relate to your professional activity.

Obviously, if you are accompanied by your partner who wants to see the country, his or her ticket will not be deductible. Don‚Äôt even try‚Ä¶

In Accountable, you will find these expenses in the Travel &gt; Flights category.

## Expert‚Äôs advice ‚ú®

‚úàÔ∏è  Always use a ticket that features the price of the flight to prove your cost. Your name is important. You can always ask the airport to print your ticket if you want.

# Deduct flowers and decorative plants

## You can deduct the flowers you buy for your office.

Indeed, flowers and plants you buy to decorate your office are 100% deductibleüåπ, even if you work from home. It‚Äôs good news for florists across the country.

Nevertheless, be careful about dates: buying flowers on Valentine‚Äôs or Mothers‚Äô Day will likely lead to the requalification of the expense as ‚Äúpersonal expense‚Äù in case of a tax audit. As a consequence, you will lose the benefits of the expense on your taxes, and will likely the auditor‚Ä¶more cautious. Be smart.

To that effect, we would definitely recommend purchasing flowers regularly to maximize the deduction. Think of those subscription services that deliver flowers to your office every week or every month.

## Go further and start thinking about your home office setup

Flowers and decorative plants are only one example of the expenses you can deduct for your home office. Think about your desk, your chair, your screen, your keyboard (and all the technology surrounding you). Don‚Äôt forget the lightning (always expensive), and a part of your water, gas, and electricity bills, as well as a part of your mortgage interests.

In Accountable, you will find flowers and decorations expenses under Workplace &gt; Maintenance &amp; decoration

# Fuel

All types of fuel are deductible, but one might be more fiscally attractive than the other.

üöò You can deduct your car fees, like fuel, according to the professional use of the vehicle. If 70% of your travels is for professional purposes, you can only deduct 70% of those costs. Please note that traveling from home to work doesn‚Äôt count as a professional purpose!

üöò üöò Of those 70% (or whatever percentage applies to you), you can deduct a (small or large) part of your fuel costs based on the date you bought your car and your car‚Äôs emissions.

1/ Did you buy your car before 31/12/2017?

You deduct at least 75%. Search the percentage applicable to you in the table below:

Gasoline/diesel + CO2 emissions between 1 and 60 gr = 100% deductibility

Gasoline/diesel + CO2 emissions between 61 and 105 gr = 90% deductibility

Gasoline + CO2 emissions between 106 and 125 gr = 80% deductibility

Diesel + CO2 emissions between 106 and 115 gr = 80% deductibility

Above these levels, you can deduct 75%

2/ Did you buy your car after 31/12/2017?

Until 31/12/2019 you apply the rules stated above (for cars bought before 2018).

From 2020 you use the following formula:

120% ‚Äì (0,5% x fuel coefficient x CO2/km)

Do you drive on diesel? The fuel coefficient is 1

Do you drive on gasoline? The fuel coefficient is 0,95

Do you drive on compressed natural gas? The fuel coefficient is 0,9 up until 11 fiscal horsepower, afterwards it‚Äôs 0,95

‚ö†Ô∏è  For VAT, the deductibility of this cost depends on the professional part of it, with a maximum of 50%

# Furnitures and materials

The professional use and the amortisation are very important!

Investments in furniture and materials for your professional space are deductible, depending on their professional use. If you use the furniture 100% of the time for your work, it is 100% deductible.

Please note that if the investment is to be depreciated over a number of years, you take into account this depreciation in the deductibility.

# General subcontracting

In this case too, make sure the invoice is detailed enough

You do a lot yourself, but you can‚Äôt do everything yourself, so you occasionally subcontract a third-party.

You make these costs to support the growth of your business: you can deduct it!

Of course the invoice must clearly state the professional purpose of the subcontracting

üîé In the case of real estate works, the co-contractor regime is compulsory when a contractor carries out real estate works on behalf of a client who is subject to periodic filing of VAT returns. 
In this case, the client self-assesses VAT (autoliquidation).

# Deduct glasses and lenses

You can deduct (part of) your glasses or lenses as professional expenses.

## Deduct prescription glasses and lenses as a professional expense

The question is similar to any other expense: are prescription glasses necessary for your work as an independent?

- If you only use them for professional purposes, they are 100% deductible for both tax and VAT.
- If you use them half in a professional and half in a private context, you will deduct 50%.

We would definitely not recommend deducting the full amount but rather a portion of the cost. Be also mindful of the total cost: purchasing made-on-measure designer glasses for 2,000‚Ç¨+ will likely be considered an unreasonable expense and be completely rejected in case of tax audit.

## What about blue glasses ?

Blue glasses are a great way to offset the effect of the screens you use in your daily work: they are the perfect target for deductible expenses and should be very easy to justify.

Go for it if you can.

## And what about deducting sunglasses?

It is much harder to justify you need sunglasses to work, so we would recommend not deducting such expenses. Your choice, naturally.

<!-- image -->

## Expert‚Äôs advice ‚ú®

Every year, every 2 years, you have to replace your glasses.
It is expected: you wear them at work, they wear down.

As a business, you can decide to invest in surgery to reduce that cost and therefore deduct a part of the surgery, ideally spread over several years - in the same proportion of what you were deducting for your glasses or lenses.

# Hospitalisation insurance

Not the best choice for fiscal optimization‚Ä¶

You are a natural person, self-employed, and you wish to deduct your hospitalisation insurance? This will not work. Hospitalisation insurance is not an expense that you make in the (exclusive) goal of growing your business. In short, it is not a professional cost and therefore not deductible.

üí°Yet specific insurances are not only good for your (financial) security but also for your taxes: pension schemes for the self-employed, for instance, are excellent fiscal levers.

# Import costs

You are importing goods for your business as an independent and need to pay hefty import costs? Don‚Äôt worry, import costs are generally entirely deductible (at least if the good you purchase is entirely for your professional activity).

#### How can I deduct import costs as an independent?

Import costs are generally composed of 2 elements: administrative fees, generally relative to the costs of logistics to deliver your import good and VAT, generally paid at the custom.

Administrative fees are deductible and should typically have VAT attached to them. If you are subject to VAT, you recover the VAT.

VAT paid at customs is recoverable if you are subject to VAT.

Sometimes, the invoices you receive for import costs are complex to read. In this case, no worries, the team at Accountable is there to help. Just contact us via email on support@accountable.eu and we will be glad to help you check if all is ok.

# Individual Pension Agreement

This cost is deductible, but be sure to keep the 80% rule in mind.

As a self-employed professional in a company, you are allowed to deduct the premiums for your Individual Pension Agreement as a professional cost, if you do not exceed the 80% rule.

The 80% rule says that your legal and additional pension  combined, may not be higher than 80% of your last ‚Äòregular‚Äô salary.

This is not always to calculate. Our friends from Easyvest came up with this neat and reliable calculator, that we can only recommend: here.

# Interest

Good news, generally, interest is fiscally deductible.

When it is linked to your freelance activity, interest is deductible.

That said, there are 2 exceptions:

1 / excessive interest: for self-employed persons interest paid on advances by entrepreneurs, shareholders, their spouses or underage children is rejected (i) insofar as they exceed the market interest rate, or (ii) because the 1/1 ratio is exceeded.

The 1/1 ratio means that the interest-bearing loan cannot exceed the sum of:

‚Ä¢ taxable reserves at the start of the taxable period;

‚Ä¢ paid-in capital at the end of the tax period.

2 / Thin Cap: For companies, the credit on loans that exceed the debt or equity ratio of 1/5 is rejected if this surplus exceeds the total amount of the loans by the following amounts times 5:

‚Ä¢ taxable reserves at the start of the taxable period;

‚Ä¢ the paid-in capital at the end of this period.

Finally, no VAT is charged on interest, so it does not count.

‚ö†Ô∏è Since the 2020 tax year (i.e. taxable period from 1 January 2019) the administration has issued new rules regarding the deduction of interest.

The new rules now limit the tax deduction for 'increased financing costs' to the highest of the following two limits:
‚Ä¢ 3 million euros (minimum threshold);
‚Ä¢ 30% of the (fiscal) EBITDA.

So watch out for business groups and consolidated balance sheets ...

# Deduct your internet fees

Internet fees are easily deductible, as the link to your activity is generally obvious. Who does not need the internet to work today?

## Subscription for your office

If you rent a dedicated office space and you pay for internet separately, you can deduct 100% of the internet subscription cost. No questions asked.

Make sure that the invoice and contracts are well in the name of your business.

## What about an Internet subscription at home?

In cases where you can justify that you work from home, you can deduct a part of your Internet subscription.

In such cases, internet fees are generally viewed as ‚Äòmixed‚Äô costs.

For self-employed ‚Äònatural persons‚Äô (eenmanszaak or personne physique) who work from home, the deductibility of your internet fee depends on how much time you work from home (i.e. professional use), with a maximum of 75%.

For instance, if you work from home 3 days a week, you can deduct 43% from your taxes and VAT. Easy right?

The tax authorities know that you probably also use your internet connection for your private life. So be honest and deduct proportionate to your working time.

If you have a specific connection for your office, separate from your family plan, you can of course deduct it 100%. But, be careful, be ready to justify why you have two subscriptions.

üí° Are you in a company and does the contract belong to your company? The same rules apply and part of your subscription will taxed as an advantage "in kind".

<!-- image -->

## Expert‚Äôs advice ‚ú®

The rules for deducting internet subscriptions at home follow the same principles as those for your phone subscription (see more details ).

However, you should be aware that TV costs are not deductible, unless there is an exception (e.g. related to your profession). So make sure you exclude them from your deductible expenses.

Yes but not as a self-employed

You are allowed to deduct the kilometers between your home and your workplace.Be careful though: you do not deduct them as a self-employed but in the part I of your  tax return, instead of actual costs.

In most cases, the lump-sum deduction, that applies  automatically, is more interesting.

It is worth considering deducting actual costs for that part from 100 kilometers a day.

# Land &amp; construction

Land and buildings are not equal when it comes to depreciation!

You deduct these investments in proportion to the business use you make of them. For buildings, you should also take into account their depreciation rate: for a useful life of 30 years (estimated), the indicative depreciation rate would be 3% per year.

Certain categories of investments are eligible for the investment deduction, both for self-employed as a natural person and for self-employed persons in companies. The FPS Finance website lists these investments, see if your investment is included: https://bit.ly/2KJaNwc.

# Deduct the leasing or renting of your vehicle

If you lease a car, rent a car, or use a shared car, you will receive an official invoice for it. You may deduct this invoice as a professional expense, provided it is of a professional nature.

The fact that you lease or rent does not affect the deductibility rate. Indeed, as with other car expenses, the maximum tax deductibility is determined based on:

1. The CO2 emissions of the lease car, rental car or shared car
2. Its professional use

To determine the maximum tax deductibility of your lease car, rental or share car, use the gram formula.

120%- (0.5% x [coefficient] x CO2 )

Coefficients:

<!-- image -->

The higher the CO2 emissions, the less the maximum tax deduction. So you benefit from choosing to be environmentally friendly.

A first example:

You choose to lease a gasoline car. Using the gram formula above, you arrive at a maximum tax deductibility of 68%. You may then enter the leasing invoice as a business expense and deduct 68%.

Do you also use the car partially privately? Then the tax deductibility is less, because you may not enter the private portion as a professional expense.

A second example:

You use the car 80% of the time for professional purposes. Then the tax deductibility in this case is 80% of 68%, which is 54%.

By the way, commuting to your own office does not count as a professional trip, but is a private trip. Don‚Äôt say we didn‚Äôt warn you üòâ

## What is the difference between leasing, renting or purchasing a professional vehicle?

While the deductibility of your professional vehicle remains unaffected by whether you choose to lease or rent it, the impact on your deductions in the initial year can vary significantly.

Indeed, the accounting treatment differs based on the acquisition method:

- Leasing or opting for a business loan means deducting only the interest on the lease, with the purchase amount being written off over the contract‚Äôs duration.
- On the other hand, renting allows for deducting the entire monthly payment. Since there‚Äôs no actual purchase involved, there‚Äôs no amortization either. You could then negotiate an initial higher exceptional payment to reduce your taxes in the 1st year of the acquisition of the car.

In practical terms, despite the contrasting accounting methods, the total deductions over the vehicle‚Äôs lifespan tend to align closely.

## What about VAT for leasing or renting of vehicles?

Up to 50% of the VAT on company cars is deductible, even if you lease, rent or use a shared car. If you purchase a car, you pay the VAT in one lump sum, whereas you can only reclaim it (partially) after some time.

With leasing or a rental car, you do not have to advance the VAT, as it is included in the rental price or monthly invoice with leasing.

üî®  In doubt whether you should lease or rent? 

Here are two main differences that can help you make your decision: 

With renting, various services are included in the price (like registration costs, replacement vehicles). This does not apply to leasing.

With leasing, you can get the option to purchase your vehicle at a predetermined percentage.

# Leasing or renting a motorbike

Will you use it exclusively for professional purposes?

In this case, the deductibility is calculated in proportion to the professional use of the motorcycle: if you lease or rent this motorcycle solely for your professional activity and have an alternative for your private trips, you may be able to deduct 100% of your leasing/renting.

# Deduct the leasing or renting of a utility vehicle

## The deduction for utility vehicles is very advantageous in Belgium.

In fact, as you probably know, as a self-employed, you can deduct 100% of the costs associated with a utility vehicle. For more information on the principles governing the deduction of expenses relating to utility vehicles (and all the relevant recommendations ‚ú® ), we invite you to read this article.

Finally, before we talk about the tax deduction for leasing and other renting, it‚Äôs worth making sure that your vehicle meets the definition of a utility vehicle according to the FPS Finance: you can find the definition of utility vehicles here on their website.

Now, let‚Äôs discuss the deduction of leasing and renting for utility vehicles.

## Opting for leasing or renting does not affect the deductibility of your utility vehicle, but it can have a major impact on the amounts deducted in the first year.

The way you finance your vehicle does not affect its deductibility: you simply deduct 100% of the costs relating to the expense ‚Äì whatever the expense may be.

That said, the accounting for the purchase of your van is not the same:

- With leasing, as with business loans, you deduct only the interest on the lease and write off the purchase over the term of the contract. You do not deduct the purchase AND the repayment of the loan üòâ.

- With renting, you deduct the entire monthly payment. There is no purchase and therefore no amortization.

In practice, therefore, the amounts deducted over the life of the vehicle are similar.

### If you acquire a vehicle at the end of the year, the method of financing will potentially have an influence on the amounts deducted in the first year.

This is where the method of financing will have an influence on your tax, and renting can be very interesting.

Unlike leasing, where it is the depreciation that determines the deductible amounts, by opting for renting, it is the payments made that are deductible.

If you start renting at the end of the year (e.g. on 24 December), and you make an initial exceptional payment of ‚Ç¨10,000 (at your request), for example, it is this ‚Ç¨10,000 that is tax deductible for your current year.

If you have a profit, you‚Äôre making an excellent tax bargain and reducing your tax base by ‚Ç¨10,000. Let‚Äôs hear it‚Ä¶.

### Remember, in all cases, cash is king üëë

When buying your vehicle, absolutely consider the financial issues:

- Do I have the cash available to buy or am I forced to finance its purchase?
- Is this a good use of my cash or could I use it more efficiently?
- What are the terms of the contract? Monthly repayments? The residual value? Interest rates? The trade-in value? And so on.

## Are you still hesitating between leasing and renting your van?

In Belgium, there are 2 major differences between leasing and renting:

- Services included: renting contracts often include the cost of registration, replacement vehicle, etc., whereas leasing contracts do not. ‚Äì Leasing contracts do not. So be sure to analyze the contract you are offered.

- Purchase option: with a leasing contract, you often have the option of buying your utility vehicle at a set percentage at the end of the contract. This is not generally the case with renting contracts.

The decision is therefore purely financial ‚Äì not fiscal ‚Äì and will depend on the offer you receive. Happy bargain hunting üòâ.

# Legal fees

Are your legal fees high?

Don‚Äôt worry, these legal costs are fully deductible for VAT and income tax. You spend those amounts during your work and they help you protect or increase your professional income, e.g. to draft a contract with a supplier or to comply with GDPR: it is an obvious professional expense.

The same logic is therefore also valid for your legal protection insurance, so you can subscribe to this without worrying.

üî®  This only counts for legal costs related to your professional activity, of course: expenses related to your civil life (for example a marriage contract) are not deductible for tax purposes.

üí° Please note that, administrative fines, such as VAT fines, fines for late filing of annual accounts, etc., are no longer deductible as of January 1st 2020.

# Machines &amp; tools

Take into account the useful life of these recent investments!

Did you invest in a machine that is necessary to your business?

You can deduct it as a professional charge.

You deduct it, each year, at the depreciation rate aligned with its ‚Äúuseful life‚Äù .

As an indication, we are talking about 3 years for a smartphone, 10 years for the development of professional premises, 30 years for a building‚Ä¶

Are you self-employed in a company? You should know that on 1 January 2020, a pro rata temporis depreciation came into force for all assets acquired in 2020. You therefore deduct on a pro rata basis for the coming months in the year of your purchase.

Are you self-employed as an individual? There is no pro rata temporis depreciation. Did you buy in October? You still deduct as if you had used your tool or machine the entire year.

Some specific investments are eligible for increased deduction for investment. Look in this list of the FPS Finance if this might be the case for you too:  https://bit.ly/2KJaNwc

Between March and December 2020, this deduction increases to 25%. This is a government decision, in the context of the corona crisis.

# Deduct the cost of magazines and journals

Have you already subscribed, or are you dreaming of subscribing, to this slightly expensive but massively inspiring magazine? You can probably deduct it.

## Your newspaper and magazine subscriptions are relatively easy to deduct.

Are these publications useful to your profession?

You can deduct them at 100%, both for VAT and income tax purposes, as long as it helps you to maintain or increase your professional income.

You should be able to justify this professional relationship without any problem: if the publication is specific to your profession (e.g. business magazines for consultants, decoration and architecture magazines for architects and construction professionals), it is obvious that you are buying it for professional purposes.

Otherwise, avoid deducting your readings. Thus, recreational publications, publications that your children read, publications that help you better decorate your home or prepare your leisure trips‚Ä¶ are not deductible!

## What applies to magazines also applies to software and other databases

As an independent, you can deduct all the costs relative to the documentation that helps you in your business.

The subscription to or purchase of a professional database will therefore be deductible. So is your subscription to LinkedIN üòâ

Think about it.

In Accountable, you will find these expenses in the Office &amp; Admin costs

üí° Whether you read in digital or paper format does not change the deductibility of the expense. Think about it when you subscribe to online content!

# Deduct the maintenance and repairs to your utility vehicle

## Your maintenance costs are almost always 100% tax-deductible

Maintenance and repairs to your utility vehicle are fully tax-deductible‚Ä¶ if the vehicle is used entirely for business purposes!

Otherwise, our accountancy partner will generally advise you to deduct 85% VAT.

Expenses for a vehicle that you cannot use for private purposes will, of course, be fully deductible.

## You should also remember to deduct all expenses relating to your utility vehicle.

While maintenance is tax-deductible, so are

- Fuel
- Accessories
- Insurance
- Parking
- And its purchase/renting/leasing, of course

Do you sometimes fill the trunk of your van with your groceries for example? It is no longer 100% deductible!

# Deduct office &amp; home meal deliveries

## You can deduct meal delivery costs on one simple condition

You‚Äôll need to prove that you shared your meal ordered from Deliveroo, UberEats, or Takeaway.com, with a customer, prospect, supplier, or colleague for the purpose of developing your business.

The location of delivery does not matter (your home office works), as long as you can justify the expense in this way.

Dates, therefore, play a role: deliveries to your home on a Friday or Sunday evening should be avoided. You‚Äôve been warned üòâ.

## Is the deduction 50, 69, or 100%?

The deduction percentage is also sometimes debated: some accountants in Belgium classify deliveries as ‚Äúrestaurant expenses‚Äù and then deduct them at 69%, even though the meal is not taken in a restaurant.

At Accountable, we believe that if you invite a business partner or client to share a meal delivered to your place of work, you deduct the delivery at 50%, as a reception expense. Of course, you must always be able to prove the professional nature of the expense.

üî® De delivery has to happen at your work space. So make sure you make a difference between living and workspace in your food delivery app.

Do you offer meal vouchers to your company‚Äôs staff? Good for them, good for you too: the employer‚Äôs contribution is deductible up to a maximum of 2 euros per meal voucher, as long as its intervention does not exceed 6,91 euro and is not below 1,09 euro.

You deduct VAT on this commission at 100%.

Be careful: if you allocate a meal voucher for a certain day, you cannot, for that same day/meal, also allocate a lump-sum allowance.

Same rules apply to the deduction of your moto and its related costs, such as insurance: you deduct it in proportion to the professional use you have of the moto.

80% of the trips you make are for exclusively professional purposes, such as visiting a supplier or customer? Then you deduct 80% of your insurance.

# Motorbike

This must make sense in the context of your professional life!

A motorbike is in fact much more deductible than a car: you deduct it in proportion to the professional use you make of it. 75% of your trips are for professional purposes, other than commuting to your work space?

You deduct 75% of it!

The controller will of course want to make sure that this use fits your professional reality: if you move around town, without having to carry e.g. tools, at rush hours, the professional use of a moto is justified. On the other hand, if your job involves carrying heavy equipment, it's more complicated!

# Deduct your music and streaming subscriptions (incl. Spotify)

## Can I deduct Spotify for business use?

It is possible to claim your subscriptions to music streaming services such as Spotify, Soundcloud, Apple Music (and others) as business expenses, on one condition: you need to use the service as part of your work and you need to be able to prove it (for example, no firewall that prevents Spotify from being at the office, etc.).

If the use of the subscription service is both private and professional, it is necessary to carefully state what the professional use is. For example, if you work 3 days a week, you apply a ratio of 3 to 7 to the subscription cost. You will deduct 43% of the total cost of the subscription. In Accountable, you can indicate the professional use and the app automatically adjust the deductibility for you ‚Äì for the 1st expense and all others following.

As you deduct your subscription as a business expense, don‚Äôt forget to deduct the device you listen the music to: is it time to invest in a good quality speaker connected to your favorite music? It will deductible to the same percentage as your subscription! It‚Äôs a great way to improve your home office setup and greatly reduce your taxes, as the cost of such speakers is generally high. We definitely recommend it.

## And is Netflix deductible?

Generally no, Netflix will not be considered a deductible expense for your business as an independent. Indeed, if anything, watching Netflix is not something that will help you achieve higher productivity and flow. The same logic applies to all video streaming services, including Youtube and others.

Please, do not try to argue that you need a Netflix subscription to be able to relax after work.

Exceptions exist if you work in the movie industry or can justify you need this subscription to perform your work. It‚Äôs a (small) win for artists &amp; creators ‚ú®

## Expert‚Äôs advice ‚ú®

Attention, in the context of SABAM and copyright fees, it is important to note that the streaming services are intended for private use only: places that are publicly accessible, such as shops, restaurants, cafes, cinemas or commercial buildings, cannot use streaming services...

Existing agreements between Sabam and other services limit copyright authorization to non-commercial use. This limitation can usually be found in the general terms of use of these services.

You do not deduct only compensations.

These costs are all expenses relating to personnel that are borne by the employer: among them, insurance for accidents at work, direct payment or benefits such as eco-cheques, sports cheques, reimbursement of travel expenses, training costs etc.

Training costs are 100% deductible. A marriage bonus or a bonus for the declaration of legal cohabitation is 100% tax deductible below 245 euros.

Sport, eco and culture vouchers are not deductible by the employer. However, they are a social benefit and are tax-exempted under certain conditions (e.g. they are nominative and do not replace the salary).

Note that, beverages such as water, e.g. cola, and coffee made available to staff are also 100% deductible

# Deduct your parking costs

You can easily deduct your parking costs as an independent in Belgium, as long as you parked for a professional activity. For instance, when you visited a trusted client, supplier, or prospect.

## How much you can actually deduct depends on your vehicle

Tax authorities limit the deductibility of all car expenses based on their environmental impact: drive green and your parking will be even more deductible!

### üöè You deduct your car expenses, such as parking fees, based on its CO2 emissions.

For internal combustion and hybrid cars, the maximum deduction for your vehicle including parking is then given by the following rules:

- Purchase before 1 July 2023: 120%- (0.5% x [coefficient] x CO2 )
- From 1 July 2023: max 75%.
- From 1 January 2026: max 50%.
- From 1 January 2027: max 25%.
- From 1 January 2028: 0%.

For fully electric cars, the maximum deduction for parking is higher and is calculated as follows:

- From 1 January 2023: max 100%
- From 1 January 2027: max 95% -&gt; max 67.5% in 2031

## What if I book a parking for someone else, e.g. a client ?

If you pay for a car park that you reserve for your suppliers and customers, you deduct it 100%.

Similarly, if you book a car park for your staff, you deduct it 100% only if the cars belong to the staff. If the employees park company cars there, you will deduct the parking according to the CO2 emissions of these cars.

üî® A fine for a traffic infraction will never be deductible. However, if, instead of taking a parking ticket, you opt for the daily rate, it will not be considered a fine. It will be deductible.

These costs are 100% deductible if this event takes place ONLY once a year, is for ALL staff members and if the cost per staff member remains low (except for the pension departure).

For VAT deductibility, you will have to look at it on a case by case basis:

‚Äì The costs of decoration (including flowers) and entertainment are fully deductible;

‚Äì Purchase costs for strong drinks, tobacco and accommodation are not deductible.

‚Äì The costs of meals and drinks are not deductible for VAT purposes if the service is provided by a professional (e.g. caterer).

‚ö†Ô∏è Until the end of 2020, catering and event costs are 100% deductible. This is one of the measures that the government took in the context of the corona crisis.

# Deduct your pension plan

PSPS, PASE: we help you make sense of all this!

## The Private Supplementary Pension for the Self-employed (PSPS/PLCI/VAPZ)

You may have heard about this already: the pension for the self-employed is not the most generous one.
Fortunately, setting up a Private Supplementary Pension for the Self-employed (PSPS) allows you to supplement safely the basic pension you receive as a self-employed person. In addition, this investment in your future pension is fully deductible.

Concretely, for a PSPS, you pay a maximum of 8.17% of your net taxable income, with a minimum of ‚Ç¨100 and a maximum of ‚Ç¨3,477.62 for the 2023 tax year (revenue 2022)

In short: it‚Äôs a great way to optimise your taxes today and prepare for the future at the same time!

You can also choose the supplementary private social pension. Both the PSPS and PSPS SOCIAL guarantee savings and a refund of the reserve in the event of pre-death, but the PSPS SOCIAL can offer additional guarantees: annuity in the case of incapacity for work, maternity, bankruptcy, death and serious illness. It is therefore a matter of comparing with different insurers and deciding for yourself what you consider to be important. Concretely, for a PSPS social, you pay a maximum of 9.40% of your net taxable income, with a minimum of ‚Ç¨100 and a maximum premium of ‚Ç¨3,966.67 for tax year 2023 (revenue 2022)

## The Pension Agreement for the Self-Employed (PASE/POZ/CPTI)

If you already contribute to a PSPS, you can also add a contribution to a PASE.

The mechanism here is different: the premiums you pay into a PASE are not deductible. However, you do get back 30% of the amount paid in the form of a ‚Äútax credit‚Äù (or tax advantage).

The maximum amount you pay is limited by the 80% rule (which means that the amount of your pension can represent a maximum of 80% of your last self-employed income).

## Pension simulator for the self-employed

Would you like to see what a PLCI, a CPTI, or both, can do for you?

We recommend this simulation created by Easyvest. Very easy to adapt to your personal situation, it gives a simple but complete view: here.

## Expert‚Äôs advice ‚ú®

Building up a pension is an important part of the life of any self-employed person.

PSPS/PLCI/VAPZ are simple levers to put in place, with low risk and established tax advantages. They are generally a good first step, but are rarely sufficient to provide you with a comfortable cushion.

As a self-employed person, it is also worth looking at ETFs (index-linked investments) or property investments, which offer a higher return (with greater risk, of course).

# Per diems and allowances

Per-diems are an excellent fiscal lever‚Ä¶ when used wisely.

The self-employed as natural persons are not entitled to deduct ‚Äúper diems‚Äù.

These daily allowances apply only to head of enterprises and workers sent abroad by their employer on punctual missions.

They can deduct flat-rate daily allowances for ‚Äù work trips ‚Äú, i.e. short-term missions, of a minimum of 10 hours and a maximum of 30 days.

Flat-rate allowances are not taxable as long as their amount does not exceed the amount of the allowances paid by the State to its civil servants, and if they indeed correspond to days spent abroad!

These allowances also have a very precise definition: they do not cover housing or transport. They cover meals and out-of-pocket expenses.

In the event that the accommodation costs include meals and/or out-of-pocket expenses, the daily allowance must be reduced. Thus, if breakfast, lunch, dinner or out-of-pocket expenses are included in the accommodation and/or reimbursed elsewhere, the daily allowance is reduced by 15%, 35%, 45% or 5% respectively.

The total amount of the deductible daily allowance varies according to the country: the administration accepts that it is based on the allowances that the FPS Foreign Affairs allocates to its expatriate staff. The list published in the Belgian Official Journal is available here, by country: http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/eli/arrete/2018/07/02/2018040199/moniteur

üí° You can deduct 100% of gifts given when travelling abroad, regardless of whether they were purchased in Belgium or abroad.

# Deduct the cost of your phone subscription

## Your phone bill is generally deductible

Indeed, as an independent, you need a phone subscription to call and receive calls from clients, prospects, and suppliers: the link to your professional activity is in nearly every situation obvious. You should deduct the costs of your GSM subscription if you don‚Äôt already!

Both prepaid purchases and monthly subscriptions are deductible in the same way.

## The percentage of deductibility depends on how much you use your phone for work.

Attention, having said this, there are a couple of elements to consider when it comes to deduction, as phone expenses are generally considered as ‚Äúmixed‚Äù expenses (both personal &amp; professional):

- Tax Authorities know that you use your phone for both your private and professional life, which is why they will impose a maximum tolerance of 75% deductibility to recover VAT.

- For the income tax, the deductibility depends on the volume of business use in relation to your private use. If you work 5 days a week, you can easily deduct 5/7 of your expenses. Do you work two days a week? It will then be more like 2/7. It‚Äôs actually the same logic as for your Internet bills.

In Accountable, simply scan, upload, or email us (at expenses@accountable.eu) your phone bill and we will make sure you always deduct the right percentage. It is as simple as that.

## What about deducting the cost of buying a new phone?

Your handset will also be deductible, generally under the same rules for income tax (VAT recovery is, in this case, not limited to 75%).  If the purchase is above 250‚Ç¨, we will generally recommend amortizing it over 3 years to avoid any discussion with Tax Authorities. In Accountable, it‚Äôs done automatically for you, so you can focus on your business, not your taxes.

Pro tip: If you are a software developer that needs to develop and test your software on different operating systems, notice that you can justify buying as many devices as you need. Woop woop ü•≥.

## Expert‚Äôs advice ‚ú®

These expenses are deductible only to the extent of professional use. The private portion is never deductible. 

In practice, this ratio is often estimated. Make sure you can always substantiate that estimate as well. 

For example, you can use the invoices to determine the ratio between business calls and private calls during a certain reference period and use the obtained percentage as a starting point to deduct the costs. 

If you notice that the ratio does change significantly over time, take a new sample so that you can always justify the percentage applied during an audit.

The VAT on these costs is only deductible to the extent that they are used for professional purposes. 
In case of predominantly professional use, you can opt for the flat rate of 75%.

# Pieces of art

Art purchases are unfortunately not deductible in Belgium

An architect who buys and exhibits a work of art in his office will not be able to deduct the price of purchase from his turnover. The work does not constitute a deductible cost, because the work retains its value over time and therefore cannot be amortised.

There is, however, an exception for works made by artists living in Belgium that are permanently included in a professional building. Do therefore not choose paintings (that can be detached) and images (that can be moved) when looking for art‚Ä¶

Please note: the regulations are different in France.

üí° A donation or patronage?
A donation is deductible as long as it fits the following four criteria: (i) the donation is made towards a recognised organisation, (ii) for a minimum amount of ‚Ç¨40 and (iii) it's maximum 10% of their revenue (iv) without it being higher than ‚Ç¨250.000.

In case of art purchases, it's quite hard to prove that the artist is a recognised organisation, though. Donations to some non-profit organisations that fit the above mentioned criteria, on the other hand, are also deductible.

# Professional insurance

Insurances that you take out for your business are always deductible.

You can deduct your subscriptions to all the insurance you need for your professional activity. This is one more reason to contract it: you recover between 30 &amp; 50% of the net amount through taxes.

Be careful, there is no VAT impact for insurance: these products are invoiced without value added tax.

üìù The most well-known professional insurances are: professional liability insurance (which protects your civil liability), guaranteed income insurance (which protects your income in the event of incapacity to work) and legal protection insurance (which protects you in the event of a legal process).
However, there are other types of professional insurance, often specific to your profession: this list is not exclusive or exhaustive.

# Deduct public transport costs

Train, tram, metro, bus: everything is good!

In terms of deductibility, public transport is an excellent option!
They are fully deductible (if the journey has a professional purpose, of course)

As a reminder, a business trip is a trip made for the purpose of maintaining or increasing your professional income: visiting a customer or supplier or visiting a site on behalf of one of your customers are all excellent reasons. Strictly speaking, however, traveling to your own office does not fall into this category and will not usually be deductible.

## Claiming VAT on a public transport ticket

In general, public transport companies are exempt from the obligation to issue users with an invoice for the delivery of tickets (tickets, cards, subscriptions). To recover VAT, your ticket will therefore be sufficient (this is an exception to the rule of proper invoices). Note that many accountants and even tax auditors don‚Äôt know this rule.

Note that the VAT on train tickets is 6%, but you will not necessarily see it indicated as such, the price of the SNCB ticket being inclusive of VAT.

## What if you don‚Äôt have a ticket?

With the emergence of contactless payment terminals, it is becoming increasingly common for you to have to pay‚Ä¶without receiving proof of payment.

Given the small amounts involved and the identification of the suppliers (NMBS, de Lijn, STIB, TEC, etc.), these charges may be tolerated in the event of a tax inspection. The only rule: don‚Äôt overdo it.

In Accountable, you can find these expenses under the category Travel &gt; Belgian or foreign public transport.

# Deduct your rent

Can you deduct your rent? It‚Äôs a question our Tax Coaches at Accountable often receive. The answer is that deducting your rental costs can either be very easy, or very impossible. Logically, your office expenses are fully deductible, whether it is your rent, water, electricity or heating bills. However, there is a complication regarding the rent in particular, depending on the type of lease or rental agreement.

Let‚Äôs have a look at the different situations.

## Situation 1: You own the building

Do you own the building where you work? It‚Äôs simple, really‚Äîthere‚Äôs no rent to deduct.

However, be cautious: some self-employed individuals have their management companies lease a portion of their privately-owned properties. Remember, this arrangement is taxable for the property owner.

As a homeowner, however, you can deduct a portion of your mortgage interest. Specifically, you deduct mortgage interest corresponding to the portion of your home used for professional purposes.

## Situation 2: You rent an office or work space

If you rent a dedicated workspace, separate from your home, the process is straightforward: the entirety of your rent is deductible. Yes, that means 100%.

What counts as proof for accounting purposes? The commercial lease or rental service agreement, such as those used for co-working spaces, serves as an example.

## Situation 3: You use part of your rental as home office

If you rent your home, you CANNOT deduct your rent unless a portion of it is designated for professional use, and this is stipulated in your rental agreement.

In that case, the following conditions must be met:

- The lease must specify a business use.
- The portion of rent allocated for professional purposes must be documented in the agreement.
- This arrangement must be formally registered.

It‚Äôs important to note that this doesn‚Äôt mean you can deduct the entirety of your rent. Instead, you may deduct a portion based on the ratio of the professional area to the total area of your home, up to a maximum of 15%.

If you don‚Äôt meet these criteria, then a deduction is not permissible.

Generally, private rental costs are not tax-deductible, and attempting to claim such deductions could potentially increase the tax liability for the landlord.

‚ö†Ô∏è A tax inspector has the right to visit your business premises: so make sure you apply the correct surface of your workspace if you subtract part of your home.

<!-- image -->

## Expert‚Äôs advice ‚ú®

Starting 2024, any tenant (individual or a company) utilising rented property for professional purposes is required to include a new annex with their tax return. As a tenant, this entails furnishing details about your rental arrangement to the Belgian government, including:
- Details of the rental agreement
- The amount of rent paid (including any rental benefits)
- The identity of the landlord

This measure is designed to simplify the process for the tax authorities to accurately apply the appropriate tax regime to the property owner.

# Deduct restaurant costs

The restaurant costs you incur for your customers, future customers, suppliers or partners are tax-deductible.

In practice, you will deduct 69% of the amount of the bill from your income tax and, unless you are a catering professional, you will not be able to reclaim the VAT on these expenses. So the ‚ÄòVAT‚Äô ticket is a bit of a misnomer‚Ä¶

In Accountable, the app automatically applies the maximum threshold of 69%: you can simply scan the receipt, check that the total amount is correct and the application will take care of the rest.

## The rules for deducting your restaurant expenses are simple.

To be deductible, you will need to be able to prove the link with your professional activity.

So avoid eating out alone (except on business trips), and at weekends and on public holidays. Even though this is not compulsory in Belgium (unlike in Germany, for example), ideally you should keep a record of the person you have invited. This will remove any doubts in the event of a tax audit.

## Think you go out to eat too often?

Make sure you deduct a maximum of 3 to 5% of your income in restaurant expenses ‚Äì or be prepared to justify each individual expense in the event of a tax audit üòâ

Good news, in the app, Accountable automatically alerts you when you exceed these thresholds.

## Is delivery to the office/home considered a restaurant expense?

No, deliveries of food to the office in the course of work fall under ‚Äúreception‚Äù expenses, are 50% tax deductible and are not deductible for VAT.

Restaurant costs are only the costs you incur when you eat the food in the restaurant.

Please note that for a team meal for an event (e.g. Saint Nicholas, New Year), the tax deduction is 100% and VAT is not deductible. However, you will need to check that it is (i) no more than once a year, (ii) for all staff, (iii) with a minimum value per member of staff.

## Expert‚Äôs advice ‚ú®

üí°We recommend that you limit restaurant costs to a maximum of 5% of your turnover and observe a certain consistency over time. This can prevent you from attracting an audit!

# Deduct road and registration taxes for your car

Yes! The cost of the vehicle registration tax and road tax are tax-deductible to the same extent as your company car or vehicle is.

If your car is 70% tax-deductible, then the same principle applies to the tax on entry (registration fee) and road tax (road tax).

This is nice, because both bills can sometimes be very disappointing ‚Äì especially since you pay these costs without really getting anything in return.

### The deduction percentage for your car and car expenses

The maximum tax deduction rate for your car depends on two factors:

1. A formula based on your car‚Äôs CO2 emissions: 120%- (0.5% x [coefficient] x CO2 )
2. The professional use.

Suppose using the formula you arrive at a maximum deductibility of 90% and you use the car for professional purposes 80% of the time, then the tax deductibility is 72% (80% of 90%). Do you use the car solely for professional purposes? Then the maximum tax deductibility in this case is 90%.

Note that commuting to your personal office (not the one of your client) is not considered professional use by the tax authorities.

You can extend this maximum tax deductibility to almost all of the expenses associated with your car, including the occupancy tax and annual road tax.

Learn more about your car‚Äôs maximum deduction percentage here.

### Registration tax

The registration tax is a one-time tax that every owner (you as an individual or your company) of a new or used motor vehicle must pay. You pay this tax to use the public roads in Belgium.

You receive the tax automatically after the purchase of your car. Exactly how much this tax depends on, among other things, the type of vehicle, the fuel type, the CO2 emissions, the Euro standard, and the date of first registration of your car.

The road tax is paid once per vehicle and is tax-deductible to the same extent as your other car expenses are.

### Road tax

After your company car is officially registered and you have paid the registration tax, you will also have to pay the annual road tax. You will receive this invoice automatically and this tax again depends on, among other things, the type of car, CO2 emissions, Euro standard, etc.

You can deduct the road tax as a professional expense at the same rate as your company car.

### Other car expenses

Other car expenses, such as car accessories, your car insurance, the interest on your car loan, fuel, electricity for charging, repair, and maintenance are also tax deductible. You can naturally read all about it, here at deductibles.be. ‚ú®

# Road and registration taxes for your moto

Above all, you deduct according to the professional use of your moto

You pay the registration tax once, for a new or second-hand vehicle.

You pay the road tax every year. From now on, this matter falls under the authority of your Region, whether Flemish, Walloon or Brussels.

The sum you pay is deductible proportionally to your professional use of your moto.

In concrete terms, if you use your motorcycle exclusively for professional purposes, you can deduct 100% of your taxes.

This must be consistent with your industry and you must be able to prove these business trips, for example using an Excel spreadsheet that keeps track of them.

# Deduct road taxes for your utility vehicle

## The registration tax on your utility vehicle is deductible up to 100%.

You pay road tax every year. This is now the responsibility of your region, whether Flemish, Walloon or Brussels.

It‚Äôs a pain, we know, but the good news is that if you use your utility vehicle professionally (which you probably should), you can deduct it.

### Whether you can deduct registration tax depends on your business use

The clear advantage of utility vehicles is that they can be deducted at 100%, unlike other vehicles whose deductibility depends on the engine or CO2 rating. All the information is available here.

However, just because it‚Äôs a commercial vehicle doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you can deduct 100%!

You can deduct 100% of this tax if, and only if, you use the van solely for business purposes. One way of proving this entirely professional use, in the eyes of a curious tax auditor, is to have an alternative that you can show for your private journeys.

## Registration tax is also tax-deductible

Registration tax follows exactly the same logic. So don‚Äôt forget to deduct it and thus reduce your tax base by the amount of the tax ‚ú®.

## Don‚Äôt forget the other costs associated with your utility vehicle

If you have a utility vehicle, don‚Äôt forget to deduct all the costs relating to it ‚Äì over and above regional taxes:

- Maintenance and repairs
- Fuel
- Parking fines
- Insurance costs
- Vehicle accessories

In Accountable, you can import your vehicle registration or road tax payment slip and file it under Vehicle &gt; Utility Vehicles &gt; Vehicle registration and road tax (utility).

# Social contributions

This is, of course, a professional expense

Social security contributions are a cost you incur only because you are a self-employed. It is therefore logical that you can deduct this cost 100% from your taxable income.

However, because there is no VAT charged on social security contributions, you cannot recover VAT on this expense!

# Deduct software subscriptions

## Software subscriptions are deductible if they are directly related to your professional activity.

If you subscribe to or purchase a piece of software necessary for your professional activity (e.g. Accountable), it is fully deductible.

Think about it: CRMs (we love Efficy, a real champion from üáßüá™), invoicing tools, creative and editing software, the entire MS Office suite, and apps such as Dropbox or Evernote that facilitate your organization are perfect targets for deductions.

Depending on your profession, you will be able to deduct different software: if you‚Äôre in gaming, you will be able to deduct your subscriptions to gaming platforms; if you‚Äôre an artist, you will be able to deduct your subscriptions to hobby/art platforms; if you‚Äôre a doctor or healthcare professional, you will need to deduct your subscriptions to scheduling software, file management, etc.

In terms of deductibility, payment methods or subscription durations (e.g. monthly or annual) don‚Äôt matter. If you buy a perpetual license, generally for a very high amount, you will have to amortize the purchase of this software, generally over 3 years.

## And if the software is used for both private and professional purposes?

Absolutely no problem, you will deduct part of the subscription fee, depending on the professional use of the software.

An example: you use a software program professionally 5 days a week, and use it personally 2 days a week. You would then deduct 5/7, or 71% of the total amount, from your taxes.

## What about VAT?

The VAT rules are exactly the same: if you use the software solely for your self-employed professional activity, you recover 100% of the VAT. If the use is mixed, you recover the VAT in proportion to your professional use.

That‚Äôs all there is to it.

<!-- image -->

## Expert‚Äôs advice ‚ú®

The link with your activity must be clear: there is no question of deducting your Netflix subscription because it relaxes you after work. 

Similarly, if the use is mixed, between private and professional, it will be necessary to specify the proportion of professional use.

# Solar panels

Do not forget the deduction for investment!

You had solar panels installed? Deductibility wise, it is a pretty good idea, as you can judge here:

Are you self-employed as a natural person? You deduct in proportion to the professional use you have of them. You can calculate this pro rata by dividing up your electricity consumption between business or private purposes. Also take into account the depreciation of this investment, which is estimated to last 20 years.

Did you, as a self-employed in a company, install solar panels on the roof of your work space and your home? You can deduct the entire cost of their acquisition and installation from your corporate taxes. Your private consumption is considered as a benefit in kind, you are therefore taxed on it, as a remuneration, at the personal income tax level.

As far as VAT is concerned, whether you are a company or a natural person, you deduct (i) according to your professional use (ii) from the right to deduct VAT of the businesses that use these solar panels.

Solar panels, as an energy-saving investment, may be eligible for the investment deduction, a federal fiscal advantage. See here if this is the case for you: https://bit.ly/3dkq6I5.

# Stationery, ink &amp; folders

Stationery is generally an obvious expense for your business activity

These are professional fees that are generally obvious to the self-employed: few professions do not require the use of paper or pencil.

You need it to do your job: it‚Äôs an obvious business expense, fully deductible for VAT and tax.

üî® To recover VAT, do not forget, as (almost) always in Belgium, to request a valid invoice with your company number. Without this, it is impossible to recover any VAT.

# Deduct subscriptions to fitness &amp; sports clubs

## It is not recommended to deduct your gym subscription as an independent.

It is indeed a well-known trap for tax auditors.

In Belgium, deducting your subscription to your sports club like BASIC-fit, Aspria, or any other one, is not easy: the link with your profession as an independent must be proven. Unless you are yourself a sports professional, it will be hard to prove.

Can you really say that you use this subscription to increase or maintain your professional income? It is not enough to say that sports activity allows you to perform better in the professional world üòâ.

## A solution to deduct it exists if you really want it.

However, there is potentially a way to deduct (partially ‚Äì at 50%, in hospitality costs) this cost if you are able to prove that you are using this subscription to meet professionals.

A risky game anyway.

<!-- image -->

## Expert‚Äôs advice ‚ú®

Some sport clubs, such as Aspria, combine "coworking" and "networking" offers with the so-called "classic" fitness offers. If you can prove that you use these facilities to receive or invite prospects, suppliers or customers, this could be an interesting basis for (partially) deducting your subscription. Please note that in the event of an audit, it may be necessary to prove that specific appointments have been obtained thanks to this expenditure.

# Supermarket purchases

It is a well-known trap: it is often difficult to prove the professional nature of these expenses.

The only exception is to demonstrate that these expenses are made for a specific promotional event, which you can then prove. Needless to say, this happens less often than your family groceries.

# Taxi and other Uber

Your second best option after public transport

You can deduct a taxi trip as long as, as always, you can prove the professional link: a taxi to the airport for a business trip is fine, a taxi back after dinner‚Ä¶ does not work!

You get 75% back for income tax, 100% for VAT (if you have a valid invoice with your own VAT number).

Good news is that Uber is considered a taxi in terms of deductibility. The good thing? They can provide proper invoices‚Ä¶

# Deduct tea, coffee, and other snacks

## You can deduct tea, coffee and snacks at the office

Do you eat snacks at the office? Those are 100% deductibles!
It‚Äôs wonderful news ‚Äì except maybe for your diet üòâ

Also perfectly deductible: tea, coffee, soups, cold drinks, and fruits, which you and your team enjoy at the office. Those might be even more helpful. Make good use of those deductions.

Always make sure to ask for an invoice with your business name and your VAT number to recover the VAT: this is why purchasing such items online might be a good idea. Up to you, coffee from the local roaster is also üëå.

## What if you work from home?

You can also deduct tea, coffee, and all of the above but need to pay a tiny bit more attention: you need to prove those are NOT for your own consumption. Remember, supermarket purchases are rarely deductible.

As a consequence, if you have no staff or don‚Äôt invite clients, prospects or suppliers, these expenses for you alone are not deductible.

# Deduct your tech accessories

## Tech accessories are a must-do expense for most independents in Belgium

Indeed, the link to your activity is often obvious and amounts are generally limited: you should maximize such deductions, as much as you can.

## How to identify good tech expenses?

We would definitely recommend you look at the items surrounding you, as you read this article.

Do you see a monitor? A keyboard? An iPad? Maybe a mouse? 
A USB stick (they still exist üòâ) or an external drive?
Your earphones, for sure!

Have you deducted your laptop brief already?
If not, you probably should.

On your phone? Have you thought of deducting your screen protector?

Also, don‚Äôt hesitate to contact us on support@accountable.eu if you have any questions regarding such expenses. We will happy to help you.

All technological accessories are obvious deductible expenses, provided you use this technology in the exercise of your art (even if it to create invoices for your clients). Think about it ‚ú®.

# Tech insurance

Good news! It‚Äôs fiscally deductible

Just like with other insurance products, VAT does not apply in this case. After all, no VAT is charged on these costs.

For income tax, on the other hand, these costs are deductible, for the same percentage as the professional use of the cost.

A simple example: do you use a laptop 5 of 7 days a week for professional purposes? Then you can deduct the purchase (or its depreciation) for 71%.

‚ö†Ô∏è  Make sure that the insurance is taken out in your name or your company's and bears your interprise number. Otherwise it is impossible to trace.

Here too, your business use is decisive: having a commercial vehicle does not automatically mean that you can deduct 100% of its fuel!

You can only deduct 100% if the vehicle is used entirely for business purposes. One way of proving this to a curious inspector is to have a valid alternative for private journeys.

Similarly, you will only be reimbursed 100% of the VAT if you don‚Äôt use your van outside of work ‚Äì not even to fill the large boot of a van with provisions for the month!

# Deduct the insurance of your utility vehicle

## Don‚Äôt forget to deduct insurance for your utility vehicle

You can deduct up to 100% of the cost of insuring your utility vehicle, depending on its business use.

Like all the other costs relating to your utility vehicle, its insurance is deductible according to the business use of your vehicle.

Do you use your company car exclusively for your business? Then you can deduct 100% of these costs from your tax bill.

You can prove this exclusively business use, for example, by having a valid alternative for private journeys. Otherwise, 85% is an acceptable rate of VAT deductibility.

# Deduct tolls

You won‚Äôt easily come across toll roads in Belgium, because in practice, freeways in Belgium are toll-free. Nevertheless, you may have to pay a toll when traveling abroad. Is the toll then tax-deductible?

As a natural person, you can deduct the cost of tolls when traveling to your customers, for example, abroad. They will then be considered as ‚Äútravel expenses‚Äù, 100% deductible.

As the director of a limited liability company, you may use your company car for private purposes, such as a driving vacation in the South of France. In this case, you will almost inevitably have to pay tolls. These toll charges are deductible business expenses, covered by the benefit in kind.

## Benefits in kind (ATN/VAA)

Benefits of any kind (ATN/VAA) are advantages that you receive from your company as an executive. These may include, for example, a company car, a fuel card, a smartphone or luncheon vouchers.

The tax authorities regard these benefits as an additional form of business income, since you also make personal use of them. If you travel abroad with your company car, the cost of tolls and refuelling abroad are part of these overheads.

As the manager of your company, you can therefore pay the toll charges directly into your company account. You will be taxed on the NTD generated by the use of the vehicle.

The advantage is that you don‚Äôt have to pay these costs, however small, out of your salary. So you keep more of your take-home pay than if you paid the expenses from your private account.

üöí You drive a truck weighing more than 3.5t? In this case, you will face tolls in Belgium.

# Tools

Deduct at a fair depreciation rate!

Tools and small equipment you invest in to run your business are deductible.

If you invest in e.g. a sewing machine or gardening tools that you would also use for private purposes, take into account a fair percentage of professional use.

This deductibility also takes into account the depreciation period of your tooling.

For tools, as an indication, a tax depreciation rate of 10% has been provided by the administration.

Of course, in the case of unexpected depreciation, you can deduct according to an exceptional depreciation rate.

# Deduct training costs

## Your training costs are of course deductible ‚ú®

You can deduct all the costs you have to cover to train yourself in your professional activity.

No matter what type of training you choose, as long as you can prove that it helps you increase or maintain your income: think of technical training, training offered by your professional associations, conventions, conferences, personal development training, and leadership training ‚Äì the list is endless!

Online &amp; offline training will both qualify as professional expenses: maybe it‚Äôs the right time to look for the training of your dreams on Udemy, Coursera, or get the best coach in the world on growthmentors.com.

Leadership training is, by the way, an interesting case: if you use the service of a coach to help you build your business, don‚Äôt forget to deduct it.

## Attention, if food is served, deductibility is reduced

Tax Authorities will limit to 69% the deductibility of training costs that include food, similarly to restaurant expenses.

If you can separate food costs from the rest of the training costs, we would invite you to do so, so you get 100% deductibility on the non-food portion of the expense üß†.

In the app, you can scan the receipt or upload the invoice, and split the costs according to food vs no food: you will then maximize the deductibility automatically.

üí° All costs related to these expenses are deductible: do not forget to deduct the associated transport costs, canteen or restaurant expenses, equipment purchase costs, etc.

# Deduct your travel fees

## You can deduct the costs you incur to travel for business

As an independent in Belgium, travel expenses incurred for business purposes, such as attending meetings, conferences, or visiting clients, are deductible.

These expenses can include, among other reasonable expenses directly related to the business trip:

- Train &amp; plane tickets
- Local transportation costs (e.g., train or bus tickets, mileage if using a personal vehicle)
- Accommodation
- Meals
- Entrance to conference or training facilities

To be able to deduct those expenses, you need to make sure that the trip is professional.

Visiting your friend living in Lisbon, Portugal, to ‚Äúget inspiration‚Äù will not be sufficient to claim those deductibles: make sure you attend a local conference, visit a client or build a relationship with a supplier and be ready to show proof of the professional nature of your trip.

Only the day spent working will be deductible: activities and accommodation on weekends will generally be rejected as ‚Äúpersonal expenses‚Äù. Also, if you travel with your family or partner, the cost of their trip will NOT be deductible: make sure you exclude their expenses from your deductible expenses.

Travel fees are a favorite of tax auditors in Belgium, you have been warned üòâ.

## Deducting ‚Äúper diems‚Äù

The situation differs whether you are operating as a natural person (eenmanszaak or personne physique) or through a limited company (BV or SRL):

- Company directors may be able to deduct ‚Äúper diems‚Äù, a lump sum that covers e.g. your food and other expenses. This amount is defined by country (see here) and cannot be added to the ‚Äúreal expenses‚Äù incurred while travelling.
- Natural persons will deduct the ‚Äúreal costs‚Äù that they incur as they travel. Make sure you keep the proofs, receipts, and invoices of your expenses to be able to deduct them. Per diems do not apply in Belgium.

Don‚Äôt hesitate to ask us if you have any questions regarding per diem, we are available at support@accountable.eu.

# Unreasonable expenses

When does an expense become unreasonable?

A self-employed person organises his professional activity as he sees fit: the administration does not supposedly have to question the economic choices of a self-employed person. If he chooses luxury coffee or rare plants for his office, good (or bad) for him!

However, the Income Tax Code states that expenses that unreasonably exceed professional needs are not deductible (art 53, 10o). The definition of ‚Äòunreasonableness‚Äô is therefore a case-by-case question, with no black or white answer.

Some guidelines:

‚Äì The proportion of costs in relation to your revenue

If half of your turnover goes to restaurants or luxury cars, any controller will ask himself, and to you, questions. For your information, 5% of your turnover in restaurant is the usual accepted limit‚Ä¶.

‚Äì The professional connection

Prestige cars are obviously a classic target of the administration: it is difficult, in the vast majority of cases, to prove any professional link.

However, the case law has already proved the taxpayer right, in particular in a judgment of 12 March 1999: he had been able to credibly demonstrate that the nature of his business and the quality of his clientele required the acquisition of a luxury vehicle, a prestigious English brand‚Ä¶

# Utility vehicle

## For self-employed professionals in Belgium, the deduction for utility vehicles is very advantageous.

As a self-employed, you can deduct 100% of the costs associated with a utility vehicle, which is not the case for any other type of vehicle where the deduction is limited by CO2 emissions, etc.

You read that right: all costs (maintenance, fuel, accessories, etc.) are therefore deductible at the same rate of 100% ‚Äì which makes the utility vehicle status very advantageous.

However, not all vehicles can be considered ‚Äòcommercial‚Äô ‚¨áÔ∏è

### The FPS/FOD Finance gives the tax definition of a utility vehicle.

According to the FPS/FOD Finance, to be considered a utility vehicle, ‚Äúa van must be designed and built for the transport of goods [‚Ä¶ and its] maximum authorized mass must not exceed [‚Ä¶] 3,500 kg‚Äù.

The SPF then describes 4 types of utility vehicles and gives the technical characteristics of each:

- Pick-ups with a single cab
- Pick-ups with a double cab
- Single cab vans
- Double cab vans

All the information can be found here on the SPF Finances website.

In all cases, we advise you to discuss the matter with your dealer, who will usually be the right person to help you choose the right vehicle.

### Caution, the deductibility of your commercial vehicle is always limited to professional use.

Utility vehicle, always deductible at 100%?

The fact that your vehicle is a utility vehicle does not automatically allow you to deduct it 100%!

You can deduct it fiscally at 100% if its use is only professional. One way to prove it, in the eyes of a curious controller, is to have an alternative for private travel.

Similarly, you only get 100% VAT back if you don‚Äôt use your utility vehicle outside of work ‚Äì not even to fill the large trunk of a van with groceries for the month!

85% is otherwise an acceptable rate of deductibility.

## Buying, leasing, or renting a utility vehicle?

The method of purchase does not affect the deductibility of your utility vehicle, but it may influence the amounts deducted in the first year.

We explain everything in detail in this article.

During a VIP event (e.g. a sporting event), access fees are fully deductible if you can prove the advertising motive (i.e. the advertising must be visible). Otherwise, it will not be deductible.

Reception fees are in principle deductible up to 50%, unless you can show the promotional nature of the event. In this case, you can claim a full deduction.

‚ö†Ô∏è You can invite your clients to Roland Garros, but to deduce this, you will have to prove the advertising nature. It's not always obvious... So be careful.

# Deduct your water, gas and electricity bills

You can deduct water electricity gas bills, in a similar way to rent &amp; leasing costs. It is only natural: you need a place to work and for this place to work, you need to incur some costs. This is valid for water, heating &amp; electricity.

As energy prices remain high, it is your duty to make sure you deduct those bills in the right way. We explain you why and how.

## Under which conditions can you deduct energy &amp; water bills?

To understand how to deduct such costs, we will distinguish 2 cases:

- If you rent a dedicated space, separate from your home office, it‚Äôs very simple: the entire invoice you pay out for energy is deductible, both for VAT and tax. The only precaution you need to take is to make sure the invoice in under your name or the name of your business. If you want to recover VAT, you will also need your VAT number on the invoice.
- When you allocate part of your accommodation to your professional activity (home office), you can deduct the professional part of the expenses related to this space. This part is based on the ratio between the professional area and the total area of your accommodation (see below for more info). You will, as a consequence, deduct less than 100% of those energy bills. It‚Äôs OK, it‚Äôs already a win.

Do you combine a dedicated office and a home space? The 2 rules can be combined: take advantage of them and deduct both bills üòâ

## I have heard I could deduct a ‚Äúfixed cost‚Äù to cover those costs.

Indeed, some accountants choose to deduct a fixed ‚Äúforfait‚Äù to cover those costs. There is nevertheless no evidence that this is correct in the case of a tax audit and we would rather recommend using the real expenses you incurred over the period.

## Expert‚Äôs advice ‚ú®

Home office üè° : To determine the professional use of your building (and therefore the energy costs), the rule is clear. You'll need to study the floor plan and define the fraction occupied by office space. 

There's no question of pushing things too far off: the authorities generally tolerate a maximum of 15% and won't hesitate to visit your office during an inspection. You've been warned.

# Is your wedding deductible?

We‚Äôve all heard of someone who managed to deduct their wedding expenses from their taxes. But is that really allowed in Belgium? The answer isn‚Äôt so straightforward.

- In some cases, wedding expenses‚Äîlike other hospitality costs‚Äîcan be 50% tax-deductible.
- Only the business-related portion of the costs qualifies.
- Tax authorities tend to take a very close look at these kinds of deductions.

## When is a wedding tax-deductible?

A wedding is a big celebration with significant costs. Being able to deduct part of those expenses would, of course, be very appealing.

According to certain court rulings (Li√®ge, 06.05.1992; Mons, 18.04.1997; Ghent, 17.06.2008 and 02.02.2010), wedding expenses can fall under the category of hospitality costs. This means they can be 50% tax-deductible, similar to business receptions and dinners.

However, the reality is a bit more complex. Tax authorities generally view wedding celebrations as personal expenses, and tax inspectors often challenge such deductions. (QP 751 of 20.10.1993, QP of 24.11.1998, and QP 276 of 24.02.2004)

## How can you deduct wedding expenses from taxes?

To claim part of your wedding as a business expense, you must prove that it had a professional purpose. This can be done by inviting clients, business partners, employees, or other professional contacts.

It‚Äôs also essential to deduct only the business-related portion of the expenses‚Äîand be prepared to justify this during a tax audit. So, including your wedding photos in the expenses might not be the best idea.

## Conclusion on wedding expenses

Technically, certain wedding costs can be 50% tax-deductible as hospitality expenses, but in practice, this is challenging.

Tax authorities are likely to dispute the deduction of wedding expenses, so you‚Äôll need solid evidence to prove that the event had a legitimate business purpose.

## Expert‚Äôs advice ‚ú®

Be careful, the administration doesn't like those expenses. 

It states that private entertainment and reception (i.e. weddings) can not persue, even partially, a professional use (QP 751 from 20.10.1993, QP from 24.11.1998 et QP 276 from 24.02.2004)...

A nice fiscal advantage

The only rule? Respect the professional use of your costs. If it‚Äôs living space costs, like heating, you need to deduct it proportionate to the part of your house that you use for professional purposes, with a maximum of 15%. Are the costs for your work as well as your private life, you need to indicate which part of the cost is professional.

‚ö†Ô∏è In case of tax audit, you will probably be asked to justify the professional part of your costs, so be prepared to defend your answers and don't exaggerate. Use your common sense!
